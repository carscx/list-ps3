Em MX vs ATV Alive; colidir com os adversários é agora uma tática legítima e não uma causa de frustração e a ação é muito mais emocionante, como resultado. Não é uma boa notícia nesta sequela escasso para MX vs ATV Reflex, no entanto, não há nenhum modo de carreira estruturado, não há tipos de veículos, além daqueles mencionados no título, e há apenas dois tipos de eventos: Race and Free Ride. MX vs. ATV Alive is an off-road racing game developed by Rainbow Studios, who renamed to THQ Digital Phoenix during its development. The game is the fourth title in the MX vs. ATV series, following MX vs. ATV Reflex, and the last game in the series published by THQ. MX vs. ATV Alive was released on May 10, 2011 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It was the first THQ game to be launched with a new pricing model, where the game would be sold at a lower retail price than most new releases ($39.99 in the United States), but with a larger amount of paid downloadable content. During the month of January 2015, MX vs. ATV Alive was listed as a free retail game download for Xbox Live Gold members on the Xbox 360. MX vs. ATV Alive was released to mixed reviews; its PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions attained an aggregate score of 62 and 63 on Metacritic. Much of its criticism was directed towards the game’s intentional lack of much initial content due to its DLC-oriented structure. In particular, Computer and Video Games felt that the business model was interesting, but made the resulting game “overly minimal to point of it feeling like a rip off despite the slightly lower price tag.”
